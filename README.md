# Skype-Auto-Replies
Simple console application that is configured to automatically reply to new incoming Skype conversations.

Due to increasing workload and the fact that I am contactable by various stakeholders both inside and outside of my department, I decided to explore the possibility of setting up an auto-responder that would be configurable based on custom groups I set up within Skype for business.

My initial use case was wanting anyone who I had not designated to a custom group that represented my close team would receive an instant reply asking them to contact a mailing list if their query was regarding support for a particular product otherwise I would reply when I could.
